### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an associate research scientist in [Verhaak lab](https://verhaaklab.com) at the Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine. I am working in the comparative genomics field to study evolutionary history of spontaneous canine and human glioma. My current work is focused on characterizing and targeting evolutionarily constrained genetic elements and underlying tissue-specific selection pressures that can drive tumor progression and therapy resistance.
